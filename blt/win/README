To build BLT 8.x-unoff for Win32, please follow these instructions:

- make sure you have already successfully compiled Tcl and Tk 8.x (you can
  get them from ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl); it's not necessary to install
  Tcl/Tk 8.x on your system in order to build BLT (note that you need the
  _source_ distribution of Tcl/Tk; the binary distribution won't do!)

- modify "makefile.vc" and "mkfiles/makefile.ini" as necessary; then type
  "nmake -f makefile.vc" to generate "bltwish8x.exe" and "blt8x.dll" (you
  might have noticed that these instructions are only valid if you have
  MSVC++; I'm patiently waiting for someone to send me the appropriate
  makefiles for BC++, Watcom and other Win32-capable compilers)

- if you need BLT's "drag&drop" facilities, you might want to take a look
  at the stuff contained in the "win/unsupported" directory; as the name
  "unsupported" implies, you're (almost) completely on your own here

- to run the demos, I recommend to first copy the Tcl/Tk DLLs to this "win"
  directory and to set the {TCL,TK,BLT}_LIBRARY environment variables to
  the appropriate directory names; now type ".\bltwish8x" to fire up the
  BLT-aware "wish" program and then, as soon as the console window appears,
  "cd ../demos; source xxx", where xxx is the file name of the demo you'd
  like to run (such as graph, barchart or htext)

As of this release, the following BLT commands seem to work under Win32:
"barchart", "bitmap", "bltdebug", "drag&drop", "graph", "htext", "piechart",
"spline", "table", "vector", "watch" and "winop". If you'd like to help
porting the remaining commands (or fixing what's not fully working yet),
please let me know. I'm not a Win hacker, so I'm happy for all help and
code that I can get from you.

Please send all comments, complaints, bug reports, patches etc. concerning
the "unoff" releases of BLT to mike@hightec.saarlink.de (Michael Schumacher).


Good luck & have fun,
mike
