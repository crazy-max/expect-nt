win/unsupported/README
======================

This directory contains code which adds useful things to the Win32 port
of BLT. The code was written by various authors who gracefully made it
available to the Tcl community. Please note that I've only included this
stuff for your convenience, but I'm not actively maintaining it; please
contact the original author(s) if you have questions, complaints, etc.

Here's a short description of the currently included packages:

* dde
  ---

  This is Ken Corey's (kcorey@eng.sun.com) implementation of Tk's "send"
  command based on the "dynamic data exchange" mechanism provided by MS
  Windows. The "send" command is needed by BLT's "drag&drop" facilities.
  Since this program is written in C, you'll most likely need to adjust
  the makefile. Robin Becker (robin@jessikat.demon.co.uk) has modified
  "dde.c" a bit, but the original file is still available as "dde.c.org".

* comm
  ----

  This is a Tcl-only replacement of Tk's "send" command based on sockets;
  it was written by John Robert LoVerso of OSF (loverso@osf.org). If you
  need BLT's "drag&drop" facilities under Win32 and don't want to compile
  Ken's "dde" package (or can't get it up and running), then "comm.tcl" is
  your friend. You may probably want to replace the "if 0" statement with
  "if 1", so that the "send" command will be defined and "winfo interps" be
  replaced with "comm interps" automatically when you "source" this file.

* tkbusy
  ------

  This Tcl script implements the command "tkbusy", which can be used
  to disable widgets while an application is busy. It's by far not a
  real replacement of BLT's "busy" command, but you may find it
  useful nevertheless.


Good luck & have fun,
mike
