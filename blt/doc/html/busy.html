<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2"><B>DESCRIPTION</B></A></H2>
The <B>busy</B> command provides a simple means to block keyboard, button, and pointer events from Tk widgets, while overriding the widget's cursor with a configurable busy cursor.<P>
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><B>INTRODUCTION</B></A></H2>
There are many times in applications where you want to temporarily restrict what actions the user can take. For example, an application could have a &quot;run&quot; button that when pressed causes some processing to occur. But while the application is busy processing, you probably don't want the the user to be able to click the &quot;run&quot; button again. You may also want restrict the user from other tasks such as clicking a &quot;print&quot; button.<P>
The <B>busy</B> command lets you make Tk widgets busy. This means that user interactions such as button clicks, moving the mouse, typing at the keyboard, etc. are ignored by the widget. You can also set a special cursor (like a watch) which overrides the widget's normal cursor, providing feedback that the application (widget) is temporarily busy.<P>
When a widget is made busy, all of the widgets in its window hierarchy also become busy. It's easy then to make an entire panel of widgets busy by simply making the uppermost widget (such as &quot;.") busy. This is far easier and much more efficient than recursively traversing the widget hierarchy, disabling each widget and re-configuring its cursor.<P>
The busy command can also be used in many cases instead of Tk's <B>grab</B> command. Unlike <B>grab</B> which directs all user interaction to one widget, the busy command allows more than one widget to be active (for example, a &quot;cancel&quot; dialog and a &quot;help&quot; button) while the other widgets are busy.<P>
<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4"><B>EXAMPLE</B></A></H2>
You can make a set of widgets busy by simply making the uppermost widget in the hierarchy busy using the <B>hold</B> operation.<P>
<B>frame</B> <B>.top</B><BR>
 <B>button</B> <B>.top.button;</B> <B>canvas</B> <B>.top.canvas</B> <B>pack</B> <B>.top.button</B> <B>.top.canvas</B><BR>
 <B>pack</B> <B>.top</B><BR>
 <B>.</B> <B>.</B> <B>.</B><BR>
 <B>busy</B> <B>hold</B> <B>.top</B><BR>
 <B>update</B><P>
All the widgets within <B>.top</B> (including <B>.top</B>) are now busy. The <B>update</B> command insures that <B>busy</B> command has a chance to effect.<P>
When the application is no longer busy, you can allow user interaction again by the <B>release</B> operation.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>release</B> <B>.top</B><P>
You can change the busy cursor using the <B>configure</B> operation.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>configure</B> <B>.top</B> <B>-cursor</B> <B>&quot;watch"</B><P>
Finally, when you no longer need to make the widget busy anymore, invoke the <B>forget</B> operation to free any resources allocated.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>forget</B> <B>.top</B><P>
Destroying the widget also cleans up any resources allocated by the busy command.<P>
<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5"><B>OPERATIONS</B></A></H2>
The following operations are available for the <B>busy</B> command:<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>hold</B> <I>window</I> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I>?...<BR>
 Makes the widget <I>window</I> (and its descendants in the Tk window hierarchy) busy. <I>Window</I> must be a valid path name of a Tk widget. After idle tasks are processed, the widget will be blocked from user interactions. All device events in the widget window and its descendants will be ignored. Typically <B>update</B> should be called immediately afterward to insure that the <B>hold</B> operation is in effect <I>before</I> the application starts its processing. The following configuration options are valid:<P>
<dl>
<dt><B>-cursor</B> <I>cursorName</I><dd> Specifies the cursor to be displayed when the widget is made busy. <I>CursorName</I> can be in any form accepted by <B>Tk_GetCursor</B>. The default cursor is <B>watch</B>.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>busy</B> <B>configure</B> <I>window</I> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I>?... Queries or modifies the <B>busy</B> command configuration options for <I>window</I>. <I>Window</I> must be the path name of a widget previously made busy by the <B>hold</B> operation. If no options are specified, a list describing all of the available options for <I>window</I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the format of this list) is returned. If <I>option</I> is specified with no <I>value</I>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <I>option</I> is specified). If one or more <I>option-value</I> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns the empty string. <I>Option</I> may have any of the values accepted by the <B>hold</B> operation.<P>
Please note that the option database is referenced through <I>window</I>. For example, if the widget <B>.frame</B> is to be made busy, the busy cursor can be specified for it by either <B>option</B> command:<P>
<B>option</B> <B>add</B> <B>*frame.busyCursor</B> <B>gumby</B> <B>option</B> <B>add</B> <B>*Frame.BusyCursor</B> <B>gumby</B><P>
<B>busy</B> <B>forget</B> <I>window</I> ?<I>window</I>?...<BR>
 Releases resources allocated by the busy command for <I>window</I>, including the InputOnly window. User events will again be received again by <I>window</I>. Busy resources are also released when <I>window</I> is destroyed. <I>Window</I> must be the name of a widget specified in the <B>hold</B> operation, otherwise an error is reported.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>isbusy</B> ?<I>pattern</I>?<BR>
 Returns the pathnames of all widget windows which are currently busy. If a <I>pattern</I> is given, the path names of busy widgets matching <I>pattern</I> are returned.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>release</B> <I>window</I> ?<I>window</I>?...<BR>
 Restores user interactions to the widget <I>window</I> again. This differs from the <B>forget</B> operation in that the InputOnly window is not destroyed, but simply unmapped. <I>Window</I> must be the name of a widget specified in a <B>hold</B> operation, otherwise an error is reported.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>status</B> <I>window</I><BR>
 Returns the status of a widget <I>window</I> previously made busy. An error is reported if <I>window</I> was never made busy, or the <B>forget</B> operation was invoked (i.e. does not currently have a InputOnly window associated with it). If <I>window</I> is presently can not receive user interaction, <B>1</B> is returned, otherwise <B>0</B>.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>windows</B> ?<I>pattern</I>?<BR>
 Returns the pathnames of all widget windows which have previously been made busy (i.e. an InputOnly is allocated and associated with the widget). It makes no difference if the window is currently busy ot not. If a <I>pattern</I> is given, the path names of busy widgets matching <I>pattern</I> are returned.<P>
<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6"><B>BINDINGS</B></A></H2>
The blocking feature is implemented by creating and mapping a transparent InputOnly class window which completely covers the widget. When the InputOnly window is mapped, it intercepts all events which could be sent to the widget and its hierarchy. Like Tk widgets, the InputOnly windows have names in the Tk window hierarchy. This means that you can use the <B>bind</B> command, to handle events in the InputOnly window.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>hold</B> <B>.frame.canvas</B><BR>
 <B>bind</B> <B>.frame.canvas_Busy</B> <B>&lt;Enter&gt;</B> <B>{</B> <B>...</B> <B>}</B><P>
Typically, the InputOnly window is a sibling of the widget's window. The name of the InputOnly window will be &quot;<I>widget_Busy</I>&quot; where <I>widget</I> is the name of the widget made busy. In the above example, the pathname of the InputOnly window is &quot;<B>.frame.canvas_Busy</B>&quot; The exception is when the widget is a toplevel window (such as &quot;."). Then the InputOnly window is a child of the widget's window and the name of the widget will be &quot;<I>widget._Busy</I>&quot; where <I>widget</I> is the name of the widget made busy. In the following example, the pathname of the InputOnly window is &quot;<B>._Busy</B>"<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>hold</B> <B>.</B><BR>
 <B>bind</B> <B>._Busy</B> <B>&lt;Enter&gt;</B> <B>{</B> <B>...</B> <B>}</B><P>
<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"><B>ENTER/LEAVE</B> <B>EVENTS</B></A></H2>
Mapping and unmapping the InputOnly window generates Enter/Leave events for all widget (windows) that it covers. Please note this when you are tracking Enter/Leave events in widgets.<P>
<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8"><B>KEYBOARD</B> <B>EVENTS</B></A></H2>
When a widget is made busy, the widget is prevented from gaining the keyboard focus by the InputOnly window. But Tk widgets can still get keyboard events if the keyboard focus is already set. Care must be taken to move focus to another window.<P>
<B>busy</B> <B>hold</B> <B>.frame</B><BR>
 <B>label</B> <B>.dummy</B><BR>
 <B>focus</B> <B>.dummy</B><BR>
 <B>update</B><P>
The above example moves the focus from .frame immediately after invoking the <B>hold</B> so that no keyboard events will be relayed to windows under the hierarchy of <B>.frame</B>.<P>
