This directory contains several example scripts which can be used to test
and demonstrate BLT's facilities.

To run them under

- Unix: just type the name of the script you'd like to try out (it might
  be necessary to set the environment variable BLT_CONFDIR to the absolute
  path name of your BLT configuration directory)

- Win32: type "bltwish8x scriptname" (make sure that "bltwish8x.exe" and
  all required DLLs are in your PATH, and that {BLT,TCL,TK}_LIBRARY are
  set to the appropriate directories); alternatively, please follow the
  instructions described in "win/README"

- MacOS: currently no way (see "../changes" and "../mac/README" for details)

Note that the example script "xpq" is a GUI for a DBMS called "pq", so it
will only work correctly if you have this DB installed on your system;
I've fixed "xpq" (it waited for the wrong variable to be written to) and
wrote a very simple replacement for "pq" which allows you to try out the
"xpq" demo: just enter at least one character in one of the entry widgets
and hit <Return>; click on the "cancel" button to cancel the (pseudo) query.


Have fun,
mike
