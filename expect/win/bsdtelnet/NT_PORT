* sys_bsd.cpp
  Need to change code to select from tty.
* Need to handle SIGINT


* Problem: line mode is not handled correctly.  We always read a single
  character from the keyboard and send it immediately.  We do not buffer
  the keyboard.  Test by connecting to port 80 of a machine.

* Problem: Doesn't work correctly with FreeBSD.
