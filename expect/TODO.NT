* Intercept all console input functions.  The input functions are needed to
  do the proper echoing.  Currently, too much can be echoed if using the
  low level console input reading calls.

* Intercept these all low level console output functions:
    CreateConsoleScreenBuffer
    FillConsoleOutputCharacter
    ScrollConsoleScreenBuffer
    SetConsoleActiveScreenBuffer
    SetConsoleScreenBufferSize
    SetConsoleWindowInfo
    SetStdHandle
 
* Make sure the appropriate translation occurs when reading input from
  stdin with the expect and expect_user commands.  Currently, it seems
  the \r\n is not translated to a \n as it should be.

* There is a problem with trapping Ctrl-C in processes controlled by
  Expect.  This is due to a bug in at least NT 4.0.  I don't know if
  it exists in any other version of Windows NT.
