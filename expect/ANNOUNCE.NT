This is a release of Expect-5.21 for Windows NT.  It does not work on
Windows 95.

The distribution comes in both source and binary forms.  It comes with
Tcl 8.0, Tk 8.0, and Expect 5.21.  It does not work with any other
versions of Tcl and Tk (see note below for reason.)

The source and binary packages for Windows NT can be found at:

INTRODUCTION TO EXPECT ON WINDOWS NT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Expect is a program that performs programmed dialogue with other
interactive programs.  It is briefly described by its man page,
expect(1).  The doc directory contains a man page for Expect.  See the
README file in the source distribution for information about Expect.

This is Expect 5 for Tcl 8.0 and Tk 8.0.  It works with no other
versions of Tcl or Tk.  This distribution comes with the code for
both Tcl 8.0 and Tk 8.0.  The Tcl 8.0 distribution has been modified
from the original Tcl 8.0 distribution.  It adds support for event
driven I/O over pipes and event driven console input.  This distribution
gets information from a different registry key than the Sun
distribution, so it can be installed safely with a Tcl 8.0
distribution as long as you use separate install directories.

The Expect home page is: http://expect.nist.gov
The Expect FAQ is:       http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html

In the NT port, most commands in expect are supported with the one
major exeception being the 'interactive' comamnd.  See the README.NT
file in the source distribution for more information on what is and is
not supported.

This package would not have been possible without the excellent work
done by Don Libes (libes@nist.gov).  Don wrote Expect, and he was very
helpful in answering my questions.

I wish to thank Mitel Corporation, in particular Mark Cloutier, for
financial support of this project.

I also wish to thank Eric Youngdale and Kenneth Liao for their patience
