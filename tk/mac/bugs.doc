We are now very close to passing the test suite for Tk.  We are very
interested in finding remaining bugs that still linger.  Please let us
know (and send us test cases) of any bugs you find.

Known bugs:

* Transient windows (set by wm transient) do not go away when the
  master does.

* Tearoff menus should be floating windows & floating windows should
  float.  They also shouldn't be resizable.

* The -use and -contaier windows only work with other Tk windows.
  Unfortunantly, focus doesn't work in between windows.  We are
  actually going to need to do an overhaul of the subwindow
  architecture to fix the problems.

* The send command is not yet implemented.

* Drawing is not really correct.  This shows up mostly in the canvas
  when line widths are greater than one.  Unfortunantly, this will not
  be easy to fix.

There are many other bugs.  However, will no get listed until they
are reported at least once.  Send those bug reports in!
